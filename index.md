## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 5, part 2
What I enjoyed about the lab was exercising our logic problem-solving skills and introducing math calculations into our code, which was new and interesting to see how it was incorporated. We had to convert the variable measurements and implement functions to perform math calculations. We also had to implement functions to detect and handle errors with invalid inputs into the terminal and what is validated.

* Lab 7, part 1
This lab was interesting because it used a real-world application to deal with a real-world problem making it more relatable and interesting to see how coding can be integrated. The lab assisted in understanding how to use conditional statements to make decisions and verify the user's input within the terminal. It also exercised problem-solving skills with being a complex problem with so much to consider like time frames, the day, and particular streets, that all together made for a personal favorite lab.

* lab 9, part 1
The task in this lab was to create a function that checks over the spelling of a file by implementing a string manipulation algorithm, making it an interesting and personal favorite lab to work on. I learned more about error handling when it came to testing out the spelling check process to ensure it worked. This was also a great opportunity to a lot of learning about data structures with storing text data by using arrays and linked lists.
